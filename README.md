### Algorithm Description

Like Random Walks with Restart (RWR) and diffusion methods in general, Biological Random Walks assumes knowledge of a seed set of known genes for a disease of interest. Unlike previous ones, BRW consists of two main steps:

- extracting statistically significant features from biological data, using themto compute a personalization vector and a transition matrix used by the algorithm
- using the stationary distribution of the correspondingrandom walk to rank genes

Biological Random  Walks flow propagation: given the seed nodes (star nodes), the flow propagates to his neighbors. The BRW not only propagatethe  flow  around  them  but  also  teleports  the  flow  to  the  target  of  the  BTP  nodes  (blue  arrows).  So  it  discovers  nodes  that  are  biologically  correlated  to  theseed nodes (just through the BTP, left-lower test node) and those nodes that arenâ€™t reached directly to the BTP but are close to many related nodes.
