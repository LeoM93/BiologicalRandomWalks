## Algorithm Description

The  Biological  Random  Walk  heuristic  provides  a  framework  to  integrateheterogeneous  biological  data  sources  within  diffusion-based  prioritizationmethods that are based on the well known Random Walk with restart algo-rithm (RWR). For the sake of exposition, in the remainder we refer to thebiological information associated to a gene i (e.g., the set of its annotations)as  the  set  of  its  labels,  denoted  by  labels(i). BRW ranks genes according to the following steps:
- We compute the set of statistically significant annotations of known disease gene
- Rather than using the standard method, we compute individual tele-porting  probabilities  for  all  nodes  of  the  PPI.  In  particular,  the  Biological Teleporting Probability (BTP) of a node increases with thesimilarity between its labels and the enriched set
- In a similar fashion,  we  weigh  PPI  network  interactions  using  nodeannotations and the enriched set.  This results in a modified randomwalk, namely the Biological Random Walk (BRW), in which flow prop-agation  is  biased  toward  genes  that  are  functionally  closer  to  thoseforming the seed set
- Finally,  we  rank  genes  according  to  their  Biological  Random  Walk(BRW) score.

Biological Random  Walks flow propagation: given the seed nodes (star nodes), the flow propagates to his neighbors. The BRW not only propagatethe  flow  around  them  but  also  teleports  the  flow  to  the  target  of  the  BTP  nodes  (blue  arrows).  So  it  discovers  nodes  that  are  biologically  correlated  to  theseed nodes (just through the BTP, left-lower test node) and those nodes that arenâ€™t reached directly to the BTP but are close to many related nodes.

## Data Preprocessing

### Computing the Ontology Graph

To compute the ontology graph, run the following scripts:

 ```
 cd data_preprocessing
 ```
 
 ```
 python3 compute_ontology_graph.py -go <path to .gaf file> -r <path to Reactome file> -k <path to KEGG. file> -o <output file path>  
 ```
The file used in the manuscript can be downloaded at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12oDaaEs1vso82UXsRe2AWeoGqNccZuLM/view?usp=sharing


### Computing the Tumor-Control Table TCGA

To compute Tumor and Control Table for each Tumor taken in consideration in the article, run the following scripts:

 ```
 cd data_preprocessing
 ```
 
 ```
 python3 TCGA_analyzer.py -gss <path to gdc sheet file> -m <path to manifest file> -rna_dir <path rna dir downloaded using cdc-client> -o <output dir path>  
```
the rna_dir downloaded using de cdc-client can be found at the following link:
gdc sheet and manifest file can be found in the data_set/TCGA/ directory


### Input files and formats

The directory BiologicalRqndomWalks/toy_example contains input files as a toy dataset for BRW.

They are:
 - ppi_network.tsv: A Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network in tab separated format 
 ```
 < node_id_1 > \t < node_id_2 > 
 ```
 - co_expression_network.tsv: A Weighted Co-Expression network in tab separated format
 ```
 < node_id_1> \t < node_id_2 > \t < score >
 ```
 - seed_set.tsv: A list of node ids (each row contains one id)
 - de_genes.tsv: A list of Differentially Expressed (DE) gene (each row contains one id)
 - annotations.tsv: Gene-annotation associantions dataset in tab separated format
 ```
 < node_id_1 > \t < annotation_id > \t < dataset_name >
 ```
 - disease_ontology.tsv: Statistically significant Disease-annotation associantions dataset in tab separated format
 ```
 < annotation_id > \t < dataset_name >
 ```

### How to Install and run Biological Random Walks


To install the framework download the zip file and decompress it. Then, Iin order to run the algorithm, from terminal go in the BRW directory and type "python3 main.py" followed by option:

 -p < protein_interaction_network_file_path > (required)

 -c < co_expression_network_file_path > (optional)

 -s < seed_set_file_path > (required) 

 -de < differentially_expressed_genes_file_path > (optional, default: None) 

 -do < disease_ontologies_file_path > (required)
 
 -a < gene_ontology_assotiation_dataset_file_path> (required)
 
 -r < restart probability > (optional, default: 0.75)
 
 -o < output_file_path > (required)

To Run the algorithm described in [1], all the options are required,to choose the other one described in [2] do not use options -c and -de

### Example

 ```
 python3 main.py -p toy_example/ppi_network.tsv -c toy_example/co_expression_network.tsv -s toy_example/seed_set.tsv -de toy_example/de_genes.tsv -a toy_example/annotations.tsv -do toy_example/disease_ontology.tsv -o toy_example/output.tsv
 ```
